### Description:
This program simulates a working coffee shop where one "agent" thread produces ingredients determined by the user,
after which barista's can take the aforementioned ingredients and brew coffee's. Each barista contains one of the ingredients needed
to produce a coffee in their local inventory. If a given barista can complete a "set" of ingredients, that is to say, they pick up and place one of each item in their inventory, then that barista is now capable of producing a coffee. 

### How to run:
- Run the "Coffee Shop" class
- Once running, check the terminal, the output should be displayed
- _Enjoy!_

### Concepts Used:
* Multi-Threading
* Java Threads 
* Synchronization
* Implementation of the "Box" method of "shared" data
* Concurrent Threads
