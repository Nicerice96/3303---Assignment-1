# 3303---Assignment-1

# Basic Components
- There are 3 "Basrista" Threads and 1 "Agent" Thread
- The 3 Barista Threads are able to brew coffee given three ingredients: Coffee Beans, Water, Sugar
- The Agent can provide 2 of these three items and places them on the counter for a given Barista to use
- Each Barista has one of the 3 ingredients
- As a result, when the Agent "produces" 2 items, the Barista which has the remaining ingredient should be the one to brew the Coffee.
